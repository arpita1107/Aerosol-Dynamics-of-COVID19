# Beggs Model
The model simulates (speaking and coughing simulation) the number of respiratory particles, originating from a COVID-19 infector, that would be inhaled in one hour by a susceptible individual socially distancing in a 4 ×4 × 2.5 m room.

# Aerosol-Dynamics-of-COVID19
The dynamic behaviour of the infectious respiratory droplets are modelled using two Mathematical models - Beggs Model and Monteiro's model.
