# Aerosol-Dynamics-of-COVID19
The dynamic behaviour of the infectious respiratory droplets are modelled using two Mathematical models - Beggs Model and Monteiro's model.

## Beggs Model
The model simulates (speaking and coughing simulation) the number of respiratory particles, originating from a COVID-19 infector, that would be inhaled in one hour by a susceptible individual socially distancing in a 4 ×4 × 2.5 m room.

## Monteiro's Model
It involves mathematical modelling of Horizontal velocity of infectious droplets of diameter 5 µm and 10 µm as a function of time (by calculating different forces acting on the spherical droplet suspended in air).
